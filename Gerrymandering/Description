Declarative Programming Project â€“ Gerrymandering (ASP + Python)
================================================================

This project demonstrates the use of Answer Set Programming (ASP) to model and analyze gerrymandering strategies in grid-based electoral systems. The objective is to partition a voting region (represented as a 2D grid) into a fixed number of contiguous districts to maximize the number of seats won by a given political party.
